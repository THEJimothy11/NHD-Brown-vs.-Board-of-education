                <h4>Primary Sources</h4>

                <div class="bib-entry">
                    <p class="bib-citation">Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). Supreme Court of the United States. Accessed via Library of Congress, loc.gov</p>
                    <p class="bib-annotation">This is the complete text of the Supreme Court's unanimous decision declaring school segregation unconstitutional. Chief Justice Warren's opinion explains the Court's reasoning and overturn of Plessy v. Ferguson. This primary source was essential for understanding the legal arguments and constitutional principles behind the decision. I used direct quotes from this opinion throughout the website to show the Court's exact language about equality and segregation's harmful effects.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="bib-entry">
                    <p class="bib-citation">Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). Supreme Court of the United States. Accessed via Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute, law.cornell.edu</p>
                    <p class="bib-annotation">The 1896 Supreme Court decision that established the "separate but equal" doctrine, which Brown overturned. This primary source helped me understand the legal precedent that justified segregation for nearly sixty years. Justice Brown's majority opinion and Justice Harlan's dissent provided important historical context for why Brown was so significant. The contrast between these two decisions shows how constitutional interpretation can change.</p>

                    <p class="bib-citation">Transcript of Oral Arguments in Brown v. Board of Education. December 9, 1952. National Archives. Accessed at archives.gov</p>
                    <p class="bib-annotation">The complete transcript of arguments before the Supreme Court, including Thurgood Marshall's presentation and questions from the justices. This primary source gave me insight into the legal strategies used by both sides and showed how attorneys framed their arguments. Marshall's powerful statements about segregation's harm were particularly valuable for explaining the NAACP's approach.</p>

                    <p class="bib-annotation">Research study by psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark demonstrating psychological harm segregation caused Black children. Their doll studies showed that Black children internalized feelings of inferiority due to segregation. This primary source was crucial for explaining how social science evidence supported Brown's legal arguments and why the Court concluded separate could never be equal.</p>

                <div class="bib-entry">
                    <p class="bib-citation">NAACP Papers. Library of Congress Manuscript Division, Washington, DC. Selected documents accessed via loc.gov</p>
                    <p class="bib-annotation">Collection of internal NAACP documents, correspondence, and strategy memos related to challenging school segregation. These primary sources revealed how civil rights attorneys planned their legal campaign and selected test cases. Letters between Thurgood Marshall and local attorneys showed the careful coordination behind Brown and the risks families took by becoming plaintiffs.</p>

                <div class="bib-entry">
                    <p class="bib-citation">Photographs from Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site. National Park Service Digital Archives. Accessed at nps.gov/brvb</p>
                    <p class="bib-annotation">Historical photographs of Monroe Elementary School, Linda Brown, and other images related to the case. These visual primary sources helped illustrate the historical context and bring the people involved to life. The images of segregated schools clearly showed the inequality that existed despite claims of "separate but equal."</p>
