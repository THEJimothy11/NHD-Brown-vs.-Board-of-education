00:00.099 --> 00:03.899
I have a, a

00:03.959 --> 00:07.819
rather big problem that, uh, I want to

00:07.899 --> 00:08.780
talk to you about.

00:08.980 --> 00:10.159
Right.

00:11.239 --> 00:13.019
I want you to give it some, uh,

00:14.359 --> 00:17.879
some real thought because it's, uh,

00:18.100 --> 00:18.700
it's, uh,

00:20.440 --> 00:23.699
something that I have thought about for
weeks, and

00:25.220 --> 00:29.100
I, I think it, uh,
we can't think of how it affects

00:29.180 --> 00:31.919
us personally.
We've got to think about the world-

00:32.040 --> 00:33.419
Right.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.379
-and our country

00:35.880 --> 00:36.799
and our government

00:37.919 --> 00:41.180
and then ourselves way down at the bottom
of the

00:41.260 --> 00:44.759
list. I want you to be my solicitor

00:44.840 --> 00:45.879
general.

00:46.099 --> 00:47.940
Wow.

00:48.020 --> 00:51.879
Now, you lose a lot. You lose security,
and you,

00:51.959 --> 00:55.880
you lose, uh, uh, the freedom
that you like, and you lose

00:55.939 --> 00:58.399
the philosophizing that you do, and

00:59.259 --> 01:01.619
I'm familiar with all those things.

01:01.739 --> 01:01.939
Uh-

01:02.180 --> 01:03.759
The number one problem

01:06.000 --> 01:06.659
I have is security for my family.

01:06.680 --> 01:10.180
Well, uh, you won't lose any. And

01:11.159 --> 01:13.579
I want you to do it for two,
three reasons.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.299
One,
I want the top lawyer in the United States

01:17.119 --> 01:19.539
representing me before the Supreme Court-

01:19.959 --> 01:20.079
Right.

01:20.200 --> 01:23.959
-to be a Negro, and it be a damn good

01:24.080 --> 01:25.599
lawyer that's done it before.
