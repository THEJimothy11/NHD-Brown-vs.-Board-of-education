## Common Questions

**Q: Can I use AI to help write?**
A: You can use AI for research assistance, but all writing must be YOUR OWN WORDS. NHD requires original student work.

**Q: How do I find images?**
A: Start with Library of Congress (loc.gov), National Archives (archives.gov), and the Brown National Historic Site (nps.gov/brvb). Look for public domain images.

**Q: What if I can't find a specific image?**
A: Use similar images that illustrate the same point. Just make sure to credit accurately.

**Q: Can I change the design/colors?**
A: Yes! The CSS is fully customizable. Just keep it professional and readable.

**Q: How do I count words?**
A: Copy text from your HTML into a word processor. Count only student-written text (not quotes, navigation, credits).

**Q: Can I add more pages?**
A: Yes, but make sure total words stay under 1,200 and all pages are linked in navigation.

**Q: What if my site is over 100MB?**
A: Compress your images. Use online tools like TinyPNG or save images at lower quality.

**Q: Can I cite Wikipedia?**
A: Wikipedia is okay for background, but you need scholarly sources. Use Wikipedia's references to find better sources.

**Q: How many sources do I need?**
A: Minimum of 10 is typical, but quality matters more than quantity. Mix primary and secondary sources.
