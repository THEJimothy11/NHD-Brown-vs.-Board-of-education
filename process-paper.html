            <h4>Process Paper for Brown v. Board of Education Website</h4>
            
            <p><em>[Replace this sample text with your actual process paper. This is just an example showing the format and type of content expected.]</em></p>

            <p>I chose to research Brown v. Board of Education because I wanted to understand how the Supreme Court ended legal segregation in American schools. This topic relates to this year's NHD theme revolution, reaction and reform in history because Brown represented a crucial turning point that broke barriers between races and transformed American society. The decision challenged the entire system of Jim Crow segregation that had existed since Reconstruction.</p>

            <p>My research began at the Library of Congress website, where I accessed the complete Supreme Court opinion and oral argument transcripts. Reading Chief Justice Warren's actual words helped me understand the Court's reasoning. I also studied the Plessy v. Ferguson decision to see what Brown overturned. Secondary sources like Richard Kluger's Simple Justice provided comprehensive background on the five consolidated cases and the NAACP's legal strategy. I examined Kenneth Clark's doll studies to understand the psychological research that influenced the Court.</p>

            <p>The National Park Service's Brown v. Board of Education Historic Site website offered photographs and documents about Linda Brown and the other plaintiffs. Documentary footage from PBS's Eyes on the Prize series showed the resistance to school integration at Little Rock Central High School. These visual sources helped me see the human side of this legal battle.</p>

            <p>Creating the website challenged me to organize complex historical and legal information in an accessible way. I designed separate pages for historical context, the case itself, key figures, the decision and impact, and the lasting legacy. This structure allows visitors to explore different aspects of Brown while understanding how they connect. I used CSS to create a professional design with consistent formatting, and I carefully tracked my word count to stay within the 1,200-word limit.</p>

            <p>My historical argument is that Brown v. Board of Education was a watershed moment in American history because it provided the constitutional foundation for dismantling segregation and energized the civil rights movement. The website supports this argument by showing how Brown overturned Plessy's "separate but equal" doctrine, inspiring activists to challenge all forms of racial discrimination. However, I also examined Brown's limitations, including the slow pace of actual integration and continuing educational inequality. This balanced approach demonstrates that while Brown was tremendously important, achieving true equality required decades of continued struggle.</p>
